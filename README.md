# Disc Golf - True Strokes Gained
 
Strokes gained is a statistic developed for ball golf and modified for disc golf. The values are calculated based on the average of the field for a particular event. However, different events have different field strengths. True strokes gained controls for the strength of field (using rating) making it a more generalizable statistic.

The code given in this example uses data from the 2021 Dynamic Discs Open (https://www.pdga.com/tour/event/47516).
